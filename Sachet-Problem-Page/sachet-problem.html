                All the time we use single-use sachets on everything from our coffee to our shampoo to our condiments. 
                They are small and handy, but when you throw many of them, the environmental footprint would be enormous. 
                Unfortunately, these tiny sachets are a big problem we tend to forget. Enough about the negative, and now 
                let’s get into why sachets are hurting the environment to know what we can do to make a difference!

            <h2>Problem 1: Plastic Pollution</h2>
            <p>
                Plastic sachets are mostly used once and then thrown after use. These are so small, and often because they 
                are so small, they don’t get recycled. They end up in landfills, rivers, and oceans. They are no good, and over 
                time, they breakdown into microplastics, which are harmful to marine life and our food chain. Imagine that the 
                tiny plastics would be eaten by the fish we eat, and this is harmful to our health.

            <h2>Problem 2: Clogging Waste Management Systems</h2>
            <p>
                Tiny sachets clog up our waste systems and are hard to separate and clean for recycling. But they’re too light 
                to be recycled properly, and they get stuck or get thrown out with the regular waste. It also means our garbage 
                piles up so that our already difficult problem with creating less plastic waste only gets worse.

            <p>
                To make these sachets, fossil fuels are used, and they release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The carbon 
                footprint left by them is not insignificant. Though little is produced, it is used every year, with billions of 
                sachets being produced. Finally, all of this contributes to global warming, and small things like this are a big 
                portion of a big global issue.

                Tiny sachets, massive problems. These single-use plastics pollute our waters, clog waste systems, and fuel 
                climate change with their carbon footprint. Join us in rethinking convenience and taking action for a cleaner, 
                greener planet—because every small choice matters.
