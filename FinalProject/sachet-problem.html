        <p>All the time we use single-use sachets on everything from our coffee to our shampoo to our condiments. They are small and handy, but when you throw many of them, the environmental footprint would be enormous. Unfortunately, these tiny sachets are a big problem we tend to forget. Enough about the negative and now let’s get into why sachets are hurting the environment to know what we can do to make a difference! </p>

        <h1>Three Sachet Problems</h1>
        <div class="Problem 1">
            <img src="problem1.png" class="problem-image">
            <h2>Problem 1: Plastic Pollution</h2>
            <p>Plastic sachets are mostly used once and then thrown after use. These are so small, and often because they are so small, they don’t get recycled. They end up in landfills, rivers, and oceans. They are no good, and over time, they breakdown into microplastics, which are harmful to marine life and our food chain. Imagine that the tiny plastics would be eaten by the fish we eat, and this is harmful to our health. </p>

        <div class="Problem 2">
            <img src="problem2.png" class="problem-image">
            <h2>Problem 2: Clogging Waste Management Systems</h2>
            <p>Tiny sachets clog up our waste systems and are hard to separate and clean for recycling. But they’re too light to be recycled properly, and they get stuck or get thrown out with the regular waste. It also means our garbage piles up so that our already difficult problem with creating less plastic waste only gets worse. </p>

        <div class="Probem 3">

            <h2>Problem 3: Climate Change Contributor</h2>
            <p>To make these sachets, fossil fuels are used, and they release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The carbon footprint left by them is not insignificant. Though little is produced, it is used every year, with billions of sachets being produced. Finally, all of this contributes to global warming, and small things like this are a big portion of a big global issue.</p>
