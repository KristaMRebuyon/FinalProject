-This is a CS Alternative Assessment Submission about second quarter modules 6 and 7. 

-The topics covered in this activity are the application of HTML5 semantic tags and the insertion of multimedia files such as images, audio, and video for HTML coding. This activity also covered topics about CSS coding, such as incorporating link styles using CSS and effectively applying CSS styling to links (e.g., color, hover effects), as well as using pseudo-classes (e.g., hover), using sprite sheets to display all icons, using sprite sheets to create animation, applying CSS transformation and transition techniques, using attribute selectors, using position selectors, and using background properties.
